# Analysis-of-Large-Dataset-of-Cars-
This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of various vehicles and their key technical specifications. It includes detailed attributes such as brand, model, vehicle class, region of origin, drivetrain type, engine size, horsepower, and fuel efficiency. Both MSRP and dealer cost are included, enabling analysis of pricing strategies and market positioning. With engine characteristics like cylinder count and horsepower, kagglers can explore performance comparisons between different car segments. The dataset also includes physical dimensions such as weight, wheelbase, and total length, useful for engineering or analysis. It is well-suited for building predictive models to estimate car prices or fuel consumption. Kagglers can use it to identify correlations between technical specifications and pricing. It is also valuable for clustering similar vehicles or segmenting the market based on car class and region. Whether you're passionate about cars, machine learning, or market analytics, this dataset offers a rich ground for experimentation. Ideal for projects in regression, classification, or data visualization.
